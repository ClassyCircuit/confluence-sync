# 06. UI/UX & Atmosphere

Confluence: https://malvum.atlassian.net/wiki//pages/viewpage.action?pageId=17858561

Here is the updated content for **Page 06: UI/UX & Atmosphere**.

I have updated this page to reflect the major design changes we made earlier:

1. **Stamps $\rightarrow$ Pneumatic Chutes** (The Sorting Mechanic).
2. **Immediate Feedback $\rightarrow$ Delayed Feedback** (Removal of green/red lights).
3. **Static Briefing $\rightarrow$ God's Visit** (Interactive weirdness).
4. **Planet Window** moved to the End-of-Day sequence (Option B).

# 06. UI/UX & Atmosphere

> 
> **Status:** 🚧 **VISUALS TBD**
> 
> - **UX Goal:** "The Desk is the Interface." No floating menus or HUDs.
> - **Key Interaction:** Physical Sorting (Drag to Chute).
> - **[TBD]:** Final Art Style (Pixel Art vs. Stylized 3D vs. Vector).

## 1. UX Philosophy

The UI must support **Rapid Scanning** under pressure.

- **No Scrolling:** The Soul Dossier text fits on one page.
- **No Hiding:** The Rules must **always** be visible. The player should never have to open a menu to remember a rule.
- **Tactile Inputs:** Actions should feel heavy and physical. Papers should slide, crumple, and whoosh.

* * *

## 2. The Core Screens

The game consists of 4 primary views that loop.

### A. Morning Briefing (The Visit)

- **Visual:** God enters the office (or appears on a monitor). He is weird, eccentric, and holding a coffee cup.
- **Content:** God rambles about his new bias (The Rule). Text popups summarize the actual mechanic.
- **Action (The Ritual):** Instead of a generic "OK" button, the player must perform a specific "Agreement Ritual" to start the day.

    - *Day 1:* Click button: **[Say "Huzzah!" Loudly]**
    - *Day 5:* **[Clap 3 Times]**
    - *Day 10:* **[Nod Slowly]**

### B. The Desk (Gameplay View)

This is where 90% of the game happens. It is claustrophobic and cluttered.

**Layout Zones:**

1. **Center (The Focal Point):** The **Soul Dossier**. Large, legible typewriter font.
2. **Left (The Reference):** The **Rule Sheet**. Pinned to the wall. Lists active rules in clear text.
3. **Right/Top Corners (The Tools):** Two large **Pneumatic Tubes (Chutes)**.

    - *Right Chute:* **REINCARNATE** (Vacuum noise).
    - *Left Chute:* **VOID** (Incinerator noise).
4. **Peripherals (Subtle):** A clock (Time remaining) and a counter (Quota).

    - *Note:* The Planet Window is **NOT** visible here (or blinds are drawn). The focus is purely on the paperwork.

### C. Daily Review (The Score)

- **Visual:** A performance report printed on cheap paper.
- **Content:** Breakdown of specific mistakes (e.g., *"You let in 3 Egg Eaters"*).
- **Tone:** Cold, distinct, judgmental.

### D. Planet Update (The Reveal)

- **Visual:** The Desk fades out. We cut to a wide shot of the Planet (The "Commute Home" view).
- **Content:** We see the city burn or thrive. The Newspaper spins into view with headlines generated by your choices.

## 3. Controls & Interactions

We prioritize mouse-driven, skeuomorphic interactions.

### The Sorting Mechanic (Pneumatic Chutes)

Instead of clicking a button, the player physically handles the file.

1. **Grab:** Click and hold the Dossier.
2. **Drag:** Pull it towards the Left (Void) or Right (Reincarnate) tube.
3. **Execute:** Release the mouse near the tube.

    - *Visual:* The paper is sucked in violently.
    - *Audio:* A satisfying pneumatic *THWUMP-WHOOSH*.

### The Rule Check

- **Eye Movement:** The player looks from Center (Dossier) $\rightarrow$ Left (Rules) $\rightarrow$ Center.
- **UX Safety:** The Rule Sheet text uses a large, handwritten-style font (readable without zooming).

* * *

## 4. Feedback System (Atmosphere &gt; UI)

We have removed immediate "Gamey" feedback (Red/Green lights) to increase tension.

### A. Immediate Feedback (Per Soul)

- **Visual:** None. The paper just disappears.
- **Audio:** The sound of the tube.
- **Feeling:** "Did I just make a mistake? I guess I'll find out later."

### B. Atmosphere & Tone

- **Visual Style:** "Bureaucratic Horror."

    - Muted colors (Greys, Browns, Beige).
    - High contrast for text (Black ink on paper).
    - *References:* *Papers, Please*, *Severance* (TV), *Brazil* (Movie).
- **Audio Landscape:**

    - **Foreground:** Paper rustling, pneumatic tube suctions, ticking clock.
    - **Background:** The hum of the office (HVAC), God humming a tune in the next room, muffled sounds of the sorting machine.

## 5. Accessibility Requirements

Since this is a text-based game, readability is paramount.

- **Fonts:** Use a clear Serif or Typewriter font.
- **Contrast:** Ensure text is strictly Black on White/Paper.
- **Color Blindness:** Since we use Left/Right chutes instead of Red/Green stamps, the core mechanic is naturally color-blind friendly.
