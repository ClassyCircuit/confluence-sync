### 1. The Elevator Pitch

A fast-paced bureaucratic judgment game where you approve or deny souls based on absurd, shifting rules. While you stare at paperwork, your decisions reshape a living planet into a utopia or a collapsing hellscape.

### 2. The Narrative Premise

You are God’s Doorman.

The Afterlife is a bureaucracy. God decides the rules for who gets to reincarnate, but He doesn't do the paperwork—you do.

- **The Goal:** You must curate the population of the living world to keep it healthy and happy.
- **The Conflict:** If you are too slow, the planet dies from depopulation. If you let in the "wrong" souls (based on that day's rules), chaos and anarchy ensue.
- **The Player Fantasy:** The stress of a mid-level manager with cosmic consequences. You feel the tension of judging souls under unfair rules while the world reacts to your mistakes.

### 3. Core Gameplay Loop (High Level)

The game follows a strict cycle of **Read → Decide → React.**

1. **Read:** You scan a soul's file for "Facts" hidden in narrative text.
2. **Decide:** You check the day's Rules (e.g., "No line-cutters") and stamp **ALLOW** or **DENY**.
3. **React:**

    - **Global:** The planet simulation updates.
    - **Feedback:** News headlines appear the next day reflecting your choices (e.g., allow line-cutters $\rightarrow$ riots start).

### 4. Design Pillars

These are the non-negotiable rules of our design. If a mechanic does not reinforce these, it is cut.

| **Pillar** | **Why it matters** | **Design Implication** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Information Fog** | The player must **infer**, not just scan for keywords. | We do not explicitly state "This soul is violent." We say, *"Fists spoke louder than apologies."* The player feels smart for figuring it out. |
| **Absurd Consequences** | Connects tiny sins to massive global stakes. | The player isn't judging murderers; they are judging "people who use speakerphones in public." The punishment (eternal damnation) feels hilariously disproportionate to the crime. |
| **Efficiency vs. Morality** | Creates the core emotional conflict. | You want to save the nice old lady, but the rules say "Deny." Do you follow the rules to meet your quota, or take a penalty to do the "right" thing? |

### 5. Tone & Atmosphere

- **Target Tone:** **Dry Bureaucratic Humor.** Mild cynicism, but not cruelty.
- **Style:** Satirical, but grounded in human flaws. The rules are petty, but the job is treated with deadly seriousness.
- **Politics:** No real-world politics. We judge universal human annoyances (rudeness, greed, sloppiness), not political ideologies.

### 6. What This Game Is NOT

- **NOT a Moral Sandbox:** This is not about the player's personal ethics. It is about compliance. "The rules change. The souls don't."
- **NOT a Text Adventure:** We do not have branching dialogue trees or deep interrogations. Interaction is limited to **Stamps** and **Paperwork**.
- **NOT Random:** The chaos is deterministic. If the world is burning, it is specifically because *you* let in too many arsonists.
