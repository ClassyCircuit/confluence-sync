# 04. Progression & Difficulty

Here is the updated content for **Page 04: Progression & Difficulty**.

I have completely removed the "Rent/Economy" mechanics. The player works for the fate of the world (and funny titles), not a paycheck.

# 04. Progression & Difficulty

> 
> **Status:** 🚧 **IN DESIGN**
> 
> - **Concept:** "Bureaucratic Bloat." Rules don't just change; they mutate and get complicated.
> - **System:** The "Progression Director" (Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment).
> - **[TBD]:** The exact number of days in a full run (Targeting 14-20 days).

## 1. The Core Philosophy

We do not rely on making the text blurry or hard to read.

Instead, we increase Cognitive Load.

- **Day 1:** "Deny Egg Eaters." (Easy)
- **Day 5:** "Deny Egg Eaters... unless they are Male." (Medium)
- **Day 10:** "Deny Egg Eaters... unless they are Male AND under 40." (Hard)

* * *

## 2. The Progression Director (System)

The "Director" is a background script that adjusts the day's parameters based on Player Performance.

**The Logic:**

- **If Player is Dominating (Fast + Accurate):**

    - Increase Queue Speed (+10%).
    - **Add Complexity:** Take an existing rule and add a new Exception/Condition to it.
- **If Player is Struggling (Slow + Mistakes):**

    - Decrease Queue Speed (-10%).
    - **Simplify:** Remove a complex exception from tomorrow's rules (God gets "bored" of the details).

## 3. The Levers of Difficulty

These are the specific variables the game changes to increase stress.

| **Lever** | **Description** | **Early Game (Day 1)** | **Late Game (Day 12+)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rule Count** | How many separate mandates exist? | **1-2 Rules** | **4-5 Rules** |
| **Rule Complexity** | The logic required to process a rule. | **Absolute** ("No X") | **Nested** ("No X, unless Y, but only if Z") |
| **Signal-to-Noise** | How much flavor text is in the Dossier? | **Low** (Short Bio) | **High** (Long Bio with irrelevant details to scan through) |
| **Throughput** | Time allowed per soul (approx). | **~15 Seconds** | **~5-8 Seconds** |

## 4. The Campaign Curve (The Acts)

We structure the run into 4 distinct phases. We prioritize **Rule Evolution**—building upon previous rules so the player feels the weight of accumulating bureaucracy.

### Phase 1: The Mandate (Days 1-3)

- **Goal:** Teach the interface and the "One Strike" logic.
- **Rules:** 2-3 Simple Bans.

    - *Example:* "No Violent Souls." "No Egg Eaters."
- **Feel:** Clear, strict, fair.

### Phase 2: The Amendment (Days 4-7)

- **Goal:** Introduce conditional logic (Demographics).
- **Rules:** We keep the Phase 1 rules but **Modify** them.

    - *Example:* "Okay, too many people are banned. New rule: No Egg Eaters... **unless they are Men**."
- **Feel:** "Wait, I have to check Gender now too?"

### Phase 3: The Loophole (Days 8-12)

- **Goal:** Test Exception logic (Trait interaction).
- **Rules:** We add specific Trait exceptions to the existing bans.

    - *Example:* "Violent souls are bad... but if they are **Rich**, let them in. We need the money."
- **Feel:** Cynical and mentally taxing. You are cross-referencing multiple fields per soul.

### Phase 4: Survival (Days 13+)

- **Goal:** Don't get fired.
- **Rules:** 5 Active Rules. A mix of new random bans (God's mood swings) and old complex laws.
- **Stakes:** High speed, high penalty for failure.
- **Rewards:** Absurd Titles (e.g., "Grand High Arbiter of Omelets") awarded for surviving.

## 5. Win & Loss Conditions

### The Loss (Game Over)

The game ends early if:

1. **Metric Collapse:** Any Planet Metric hits **0**. (e.g., "Total Anarchy").

    - *Narrative:* God decides the project is a failure. He wipes the slate clean (and you with it).

### The Win (Endings)

The game has multiple endings to encourage replayability.

1. **Ending A: The Bureaucrat (Standard)**

    - *Requirement:* Survive to Day 15 with Metrics &gt; 0.
    - *Outcome:* You get a permanent promotion to Middle Management. The cycle continues.
2. **Ending B: The Utopia (Hidden)**

    - *Requirement:* Maintain all Metrics &gt; 90 for 3 days.
    - *Outcome:* The world becomes self-sustaining. The Department of Souls is abolished. You are free.
3. **Ending C: The Agent of Chaos (Hidden)**

    - *Requirement:* Keep Metrics critically low (10-20) without hitting 0 for 5 days.
    - *Outcome:* God decides he actually *likes* the drama. You are promoted to "Director of Entertainment."
4. **Ending D: The Specific Bias (Joke Ending)**

    - *Requirement:* Follow one specific quirky rule perfectly (e.g., "The Egg Ban") while ignoring all others.
    - *Outcome:* You unlock the "Egg World" timeline.
